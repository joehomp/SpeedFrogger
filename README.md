Speed Frogger
===============================
### Description
Speed Frogger is an HTML Canvas / Javascript game that loosely resembles the classic arcade game Frogger. This project originated from the course *Object-Oriented JavaScript* class from *Udacity*.  The goal was to excercise Javascript functionality such as classes, inheritance, & closures.  This project turned out to be a fun excuse to use some Javascript.

### To Play
*(Follow the displayed on-screen instructions.)*

Your goal is to use the arrow keys to avoid the 
angry bugs as you move your character to the water.  Collect as
many bonus gems as possible along the way for bonus points.
Score as many points as possible in the allotted game time.

Good Luck!

##### Scoring:
- Reach the water -> 1 point
- Collect a gem -> 1 point
- Get eaten by a bug -> -1 point
